## BUIDL Bootcamp Step Through

This repo will be an exercise space as I step through Justin Moon's BUIDL Bootcamp again. The course is one in understanding some of the underlying concepts behind Bitcoin. It achieves this by starting with a very naive implementation of digital cash and then progressively builds up to Bitcoin by solving problems with our system along the way.

The different steps in getting to Bitcoin will be:
1. PNGCoin
1. ECDSACoin
1. BankCoin
1. DivisiCoin
1. BlockCoin
1. HashCoin
1. **Bitcoin**
